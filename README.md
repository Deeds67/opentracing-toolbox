> **Tracer** noun, /ˈtɹeɪsɚ/: A round of ammunition that contains a flammable substance that produces a visible trail when fired in the dark.

*Tracer* is a library that manages custom trace identifiers and carries them through distributed systems. Traditionally traces are transported as custom HTTP headers, usually generated by clients on the very first request. Traces are added  to any subsequent requests and responses, especially to transitive dependencies. Having a consistent trace across different services in a system allows to correlate requests and responses beyond the traditional single client-server communication.

This library historically originates from a closed-source implementation called *Flow-ID*. The goal was to create a clean open source version in which we could get rid of all the drawbacks of the old implementation, e.g. strong-coupling to internal libraries, single hard-coded header and limited testability.

- **Status**: Under development and used in production

## Features

-  **Tracing** of HTTP requests and responses
-  **Customization** by having a pluggable trace format and lifecycle listeners for easy integration
-  **Support** for Servlet containers, Apache’s HTTP client, Hystrix, JUnit, AspectJ and (via its elegant API) several other frameworks
-  Convenient [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Auto Configuration
-  Sensible defaults

- Any build tool using Maven Central, or direct download
- Servlet Container (optional)

## Installation

Selectively add the following dependencies to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-core</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-servlet</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-hystrix</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-aspectj</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-junit</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zalando</groupId>
    <artifactId>tracer-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${tracer.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

After adding the dependency, create a `Tracer` and specify the name of the traces you want to manage:

```java
Tracer tracer = Tracer.create("X-Trace-ID");
```

If you need access to the current trace's value, call `getValue()` on it:

```java
Trace trace = tracer.get("X-Trace-ID"); // this is a live-view that can be a shared as a singleton
entity.setLastModifiedBy(trace.getValue());
```

By default there can only be one trace active at a time. Sometimes it can be useful to *stack* traces:

```java
Tracer tracer = Tracer.builder()
    .stacked(true)
    .trace("X-Trace-ID")
    .build();
```

### Generators

When starting a new trace, *Tracer* will create trace value by means of pre-configured generator.
You can override this on a per-trace level by adding the following to your setup:

```java
Tracer tracer = Tracer.builder()
        .trace("X-Trace-ID", new CustomGenerator())
        .build();
```

There are several generator implementations included.

#### UUIDGenerator

This is the default generator implementation.
It creates 36 characters long, random-based UUID string as a trace value.

#### FlowIDGenerator

This generator was created for historical reasons.
It basically renders a UUID as a base64-encoded byte array, e.g. `REcCvlqMSReeo7adheiYFA`.
The length of generated value is 22 characters.

#### PhraseGenerator

Phrase generator provides over 10^9 different phrases like:

    tender_goodall_likes_evil_panini
    nostalgic_boyd_helps_agitated_noyce
    pensive_allen_tells_fervent_einstein

The generated phrase is 22 to 61 character long.

### Listeners

For some use cases, e.g. integration with other frameworks and libraries, it might be useful to register a listener that gets notified every time a trace is either started or stopped.

```java
Tracer tracer = Tracer.builder()
        .trace("X-Trace-ID")
        .listener(new CustomTraceListener())
        .build();
```

*Tracer* comes with a very useful listener by default, the `MDCTraceListener`:

```java
Tracer tracer = Tracer.builder()
        .trace("X-Trace-ID")
        .listener(new MDCTraceListener())
        .build();
```

It allows you to add the trace id to every log line:

```xml
<PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} [%X{X-Trace-ID}] - %msg%n"/>
```

Another built-in listener is the `LoggingTraceListener` which logs the start and end of every trace.

## Servlet

On the server side is a single filter that you must be register in your filter chain. Make sure it runs very early — otherwise you might miss some crucial information when debugging.

You have to register the `TracerFilter` as a `Filter` in your filter chain:

```java
context.addFilter("TracerFilter", new TracerFilter(tracer))
    .addMappingForUrlPatterns(EnumSet.of(REQUEST, ASYNC, ERROR), true, "/*");
```

## Apache HTTP Client

Many client-side HTTP libraries on the JVM use the Apache HTTPClient, which is why *Tracer* comes with a request interceptor:

```java
DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
client.addRequestInterceptor(new TracerHttpRequestInterceptor(tracer));
```

## Hystrix

*Tracer* comes with built-in Hystrix support in form of a custom `HystrixConcurrencyStrategy`:

```java
final HystrixPlugins plugins = HystrixPlugins.getInstance();
final HystrixConcurrencyStrategy delegate = HystrixConcurrencyStrategyDefault.getInstance(); // or another
plugins.registerConcurrencyStrategy(new TracerConcurrencyStrategy(tracer, delegate));
```

## AspectJ

For background jobs and tests, you can use the built-in aspect:

```java
@Traced
public void performBackgroundJob() {
    // do work
}
```

or you can manage the lifecycle yourself:

```java
tracer.start();

try {
    // do work
} finally {
    tracer.stop();
}
```

## JUnit

*Tracer* comes with a special `TestRule` that manages traces for every test run for you:

```java
@Rule
public final TracerRule tracing = new TracerRule(tracer);
```

It also supports JSR-330-compliant dependency injection frameworks: 

```java
@Inject
@Rule
public final TracerRule tracing;
```

## Spring Boot Starter

*Tracer* comes with a convenient auto configuration for Spring Boot users that sets up aspect, servlet filter and MDC support automatically with sensible defaults:

| Configuration               | Description                                                                                   | Default                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `tracer.stacked`            | Enables stacking of traces                                                                    | `false`                     |
| `tracer.aspect.enabled`     | Enables the [`TracedAspect`](#aspect)                                                         | `true`                      |

| `tracer.filter.enabled`     | Enables the [`TracerFilter`](#servlet)                                                        | `true`                      |
| `tracer.logging.enabled`    | Enables the [`LoggingTraceListener`](#logging)                                                | `false`                     |
| `tracer.logging.category`   | Changes the category of the [`LoggingTraceListener`](#logging)                                | `org.zalando.tracer.Tracer` |
| `tracer.mdc.enabled`        | Enables the [`MdcTraceListener`](#logging)                                                    | `true`                      |
| `tracer.scheduling.enabled` | Enables support for Task Scheduling, i.e. `@Scheduled`                                        | `true`                      |
| `tracer.traces`             | Configures actual traces, mapping from name to generator type (`uuid`, `flow-id` or `phrase`) |                             |

```yaml
tracer:
    aspect.enabled: true
    async.enabled: true
    filter.enabled: true
    logging:
        enabled: false
        category: org.zalando.tracer.Tracer
    mdc.enabled: true
    scheduling.enabled: true
    traces:
        X-Trace-ID: uuid
        X-Flow-ID: flow-id
```

The `TracerAutoConfiguration` will automatically pick up any `TraceListener` bound in the application context.
